This code implements the paper Learning Time-Critical Responses for Interactive Character Control. This system implements teacher-student framework to learn time-critically responsive policies, which guarantee the time-to-completion between user inputs and their associated responses regardless of the size and composition of the motion databases. This code is written in java and Python, based on Tensorflow2.

This opensource is a collaboration between Seoul National University and NCSOFT. Additional information about the code can be found at the URL below.
